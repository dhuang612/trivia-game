Assumptions
  - A round of trivia has 10 Questions
  - All questions are multiple-choice questions
  - Your score does not need to update in real time
  - Results can update on form submit, button click, or any interaction you choose
  - We will provide you with the trivia data such as the questions, correct and incorrect answers via a JSON file.

Acceptance Criteria
  - A user can view questions.
  - Questions with their multiple choice options must be displayed one at a time.
  - Questions should not repeat in a round.
  - A user can select only 1 answer out of the 4 possible answers.
  - The correct answer must be revealed after a user has submitted their answer
  - A user can see the score they received at the end of the round

future goals:

I am currently showing the previous right answer regardless of if they got the answer correct or not. It would be cool to add in logic to make it only show the answer if they got it wrong.

be able to store your score so you can challenge your friends to beat your score. 
maybe use local storage?

It would be cool to have an ability for the end user to add in their own question and answers.
